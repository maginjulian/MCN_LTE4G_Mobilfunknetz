\begin{abstract}
	This paper gives an overview about the basic components of a Long Term Evolution network (LTE). Furthermore, it deals with a specific scenario to build up a LTE network. In that case the assumption is to be an owner of an island with the intention to build a LTE infrastructure there. On the one hand open source software solutions used to run without proprietary hardware are discussed as well as on the other hand possible LTE providers, that might also offer specialised services, are taken into consideration in this paper.
