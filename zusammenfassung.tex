\begin{abstract}
	This paper gives an overview about the basic components of a Long Term Evolution network (LTE). Furthermore, it deals with a specific scenario to build up an own LTE network. In that case the assumption is to be an owner of an island with the intention to build a LTE infrastructure there. Which open source software is available, that can be used and run without proprietary hardware and which LTE providers are available, that might also offer specialised services is taken into consideration.
